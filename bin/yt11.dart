  The clock!

  Can you print a clock? Basically, create every hour, minute, second of a clock.
  Ie

  Create nested for loops!

  One that counts from 0-23 (HOURS)
  Another that counts from 0-59 (MINUTE)
  And another that also counts from 0-59 (SECONDS)

  And print every minute of the day. From 00:00:00 -> 23:59:59

  00:00:00 -> 0:0:0
  00:00:01 -> 0:0:1
  00:00:02
  00:00:03
  00:00:10 -> 0:0:10
  ..
  23:59:59

  HINT: To make the program more readable to your, call your variables in
        each for loop something understandable, like for(int hour ....)

  HINT: You WILL have the issue of wanting to print 01 for example, but that's
        hard to do with a simple print statement. You will have to pad the number.
        You can pad a number, so that if its only 1 digit, it will get a 0 prefix
        with the following command

        int idx = 1;
        print(hour.toString().padLeft(2, '0'));

        This prints out 01!
        If you set idx=10, you will simply get 10.

String fmt(int number){
  return number.toString().padLeft(2, '0');
}

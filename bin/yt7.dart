/*
  Now, we are getting to the good stuff!

  Look at this for loop, it will loop through myList and each list
  inside that list, it returns the innerList.

    for(List<int> innerList in myList){
      print(innerList);
    }

  Instead of the print statement, create a for loop WITHIN this for loop, that
  loops through each integer of innerList and prints it. Use the same for
  loop definition (i.e the IN for loop)

  You should end up with this in the console

/*
  When you are working with a list of lists that contain numbers, you usually
  don't say "list of lists" but you often refer to them as a "matrix.

  However, for a matrix to be valid, it must be symmetric

  This is a valid matrix, it has two rows and each row has two columns
  [10, 11]
  [12, 34]

  This is not valid matrix, one of the rows has longer than 3 items!
  [10, 11]
  [12, 34, 15]

  Generally, if you have N rows, you should have N columns as well for it to
  be a valid matrix.

  YOUR JOB
  Write a function that determines if the given list of lists is valid
  meaning that for each row, it has the same number of columns

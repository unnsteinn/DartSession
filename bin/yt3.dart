/*
  Now, if you understand yt2 and what type you are fetching. Complete these
  tasks here

  1. Extract the middle list into a separate variable and print that variable.
     For example, for List<int> myList = [1, 2, 3] I would extract the middle variable
     into int middleVariable = myList[1]. How does this look for list of lists?

  2. From that variable that contains the middle list, extract the middle number
     into a separate variable and print it.

  BONUS CHALLENGE:
  Can you extract the variable you got from step 2. STRAIGHT from myList into
  a separate variable? I.e, you should end up with

  int bonusChallenge = myList?????????
  print(bonusChallenge);

  And it should print 9.
